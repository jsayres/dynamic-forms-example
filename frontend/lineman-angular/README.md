# An AngularJS Admin Interface

This project was built using [Lineman](http://www.linemanjs.com) and a starting template for Angular JS applications.

It is currently limited to a dynamic forms app in which forms are created by
website staff and/or administrators and then published for regular website
visitors to fill out.
